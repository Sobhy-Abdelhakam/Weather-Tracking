# Weather Tracking

## Overview
Weather Tracking is an Android application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that displays real-time, location-based weather information. The app is designed with a clean architecture (MVVM) and uses only native Android components and APIs; no third-party libraries are used.

## Application Flow:
1. Checks the internet connection. If offline, it displays a toast message to the user.
2. Checks location access permissions.
3. Checks if GPS is enabled:
   - If enabled, fetches the current location.
   - If disabled, attempts to use the last known location from cache.
5. Get the current weather data and 5-day forecast
6. The application has two screens: one for the current, refreshable weather, and another for the five-day forecast.
7. The application handles offline mode, which caches the last retrieved data locally
